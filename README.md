# Genomic profiling of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) using whole-exome sequencing

This repository was created to store the coding scripts and results I carried out while developing my dissertation on "Genomic profiling of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) using whole-exome sequencing", for the Master's degree in Bioinformatics, between February 2023 and January 2024. Sensitive data has been removed from the repository. This work results from a collaboration between the University of Minho, Portugal, and the Barretos Cancer Hospital, Brazil.


## Dissertation abstract

Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) are rare tumours, yet they constitute the most prevalent mesenchymal neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract, affecting mostly the stomach and small intestine. Although the majority of GIST has alterations in the _KIT_ and _PDGFRA_ proto-oncogenes, 15% are considered wild-type GIST. _KIT_ and _PDGFRA_-mutated GIST are more sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitor than wild-type GIST, emphasizing the urgency to study the GIST genomic profiling. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches, such as whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES), are crucial for precision oncology and targeted therapy research. Analysing the amount of data generated by exome sequencing requires expertise in bioinformatics. There are several challenges in this analysis, including the need for manual curation, the lack of a universal tool or pipeline, and inherent variability among well-established bioinformatics tools. Regardless of the challenges, bioinformatics has a crucial role in cancer genomics. This dissertation aimed to assess the genomic profile of nineteen Brazilian GIST patients, using WES, and correlate the molecular profile with their clinical features. The cohort ranged in age from 44 to 76 years. The most common primary tumour location was the stomach, followed by the small intestine. There is a 75% chance of survival for almost 7 years. The initial pool of variants was 10.981 and, through variant filtering, 212 variants with potential for pathogenicity were identified. After variant classification using three different approaches ([Cancer Genome Interpreter (CGI)](http://www.cancergenomeinterpreter.org) tool and the Association for Molecular Pathology/American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/College of American Pathologists (AMP/ACMG/CAP) and Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) guidelines), 31 variants with evidence of pathogenicity were found. _KIT_ and _PDGFRA_ remained the most mutated genes, although other genes unrelated to cancer were identified in _KIT_-mutant GIST. A wild-type GIST with a variant in _EGFR_ was identified, suggesting that this gene may be involved in this disease. This study provided interesting insights into the specific genetic landscape of GIST in the Brazilian population.
