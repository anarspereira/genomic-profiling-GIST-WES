# Genomic profiling of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) using whole-exome sequencing

This repository was created to store the coding scripts and results I carried out while developing my dissertation on "Genomic profiling of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) using whole-exome sequencing", for the Master's degree in Bioinformatics, between February 2023 and January 2024. Sensitive data has been removed from the repository. This work results from a collaboration between the University of Minho, Portugal, and the Barretos Cancer Hospital, Brazil.


## Dissertation abstract

Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are rare tumours, yet they constitute the most prevalent mesenchymal neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract, affecting mostly the stomach and small intestine. Although the majority of GISTs have alterations in the KIT and PDGFRA proto-oncogenes, 15% are considered wild-type GIST. KIT and PDGFRA-mutated GISTs are more sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) than wild-type GIST, emphasizing the urgency to study the GIST genomic profiling. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches are crucial for precision oncology and targeted therapy research. Analysing the amount of data generated by exome sequencing requires expertise in bioinformatics. There are several challenges in this analysis, including the need for manual curation, the lack of a universal pipeline, and inherent variability among well-established bioinformatics tools. Regardless of the challenges, bioinformatics has a crucial role in cancer genomics. This dissertation aimed to assess the genomic profile of 19 Brazilian GIST patients, using WES of paired tumour/blood, and correlate the molecular profile with their clinical features. The cohort ranged in age from 44 to 76 years. The most common primary tumour location was the stomach, followed by the small intestine. The initial pool of somatic variants was 10.981 and, through variant filtering, 212 variants with potential for pathogenicity were identified. After variant classification using three different approaches, 31 variants with evidence of pathogenicity were found. KIT and PDGFRA remained the most mutated genes, although other genes unrelated to cancer were identified in KIT-mutant GISTs. A wild-type GIST with a variant in EGFR was identified, suggesting that this gene may be involved in this disease. The 5-year survival rate was 89.5%. Patients with higher Fletcher malignancy risk had lower overall survival. KIT-mutant GISTs showed a 5-year survival rate of 86.7%, while patients with alterations in PDGFRA tended to have higher overall survival. This study provided interesting insights into the specific genetic landscape of GISTs in a Brazilian population.
